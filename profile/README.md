## What Is EverWebinar?

EverWebinar is an automated webinar platform developed by Genesis Digital, the same company that created WebinarJam.  

Instead of hosting webinars live, you upload a pre-recorded session and EverWebinar simulates a live broadcast with chat, polls and offers. So your audience can join at convenient times while you‚Äôre off doing something else.  

**Features include:**  
- Automated webinars  
- Hybrid webinars (mixing live and recorded segments)  
- Just-in-time sessions  
- Flexible scheduling  
- Live chat simulator  
- Professional page templates  
- A/B split testing  
- Email/SMS system  
- Clickable offers and polls  

There‚Äôs also a **30-day money-back guarantee** ‚Äî if you cancel within 30 days you get a full refund.  

EverWebinar isn‚Äôt meant to replace Zoom or Google Meet for live meetings. It shines when you want to automate a high-performing webinar and let it run repeatedly.  

During my trial I set up a 45-minute product demo with a pre-recorded Q&A segment. The system allowed me to schedule sessions every hour and attendees saw a countdown timer that made the session feel live.  

I could pop into the chat from my phone when someone asked a question and I watched real-time conversions as people clicked my call-to-action button. The automation felt a bit weird at first but it‚Äôs effective for evergreen sales funnels.

## EverWebinar Pricing & Plans

EverWebinar currently has three standard plans on their website. The only difference between them is the billing frequency and the associated savings. All plans include the same features.  

| Plan     | Regular Price | Discounted Price | Savings              | Notes                                   |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Monthly  | $99/month     | $99/month        | ‚Äì                    | Month-to-month; cancel anytime           |
| Annual   | $1,188/year   | $499/year        | Save $689 (‚âà58% off) | Billed as one payment                    |
| Biennial | $2,376/2 yrs  | $874/2 years     | Save $1,502 (‚âà66% off) | Effectively $37/month; includes 3 free months |

The annual and biennial plans have the biggest discounts. The official site even breaks it down to **$42/month** for the annual plan and **$37/month** for the biennial plan.  

I chose the annual plan for my test because it locked in the savings without a 2-year commitment. Paying $499 upfront can feel steep but in my experience you‚Äôll recoup that cost quickly if you use webinars to sell a product or course.  

---

## Free Trial vs. Money-Back Guarantee

EverWebinar doesn‚Äôt offer a completely free trial.  

- **$1 Trial** ‚Äì 30-day trial for $1.  
- **14-day free trial promotions** ‚Äì Still require a $1 payment.  
- **30-day money-back guarantee** ‚Äì Buy a plan, cancel within 30 days for a full refund.  

This is essentially a risk-free trial but you must pay upfront.  

---

## Hidden Student & Nonprofit Discounts

EverWebinar also offers special pricing for **students, educators and nonprofits** if you contact support directly.  

This is not publicly advertised and you won‚Äôt find a coupon code for it. If you‚Äôre a qualifying organization it‚Äôs worth reaching out to EverWebinar to see if you can get a custom rate.

## What About EverWebinar Coupon Codes?

When you search for ‚ÄúEverWebinar coupon‚Äù you‚Äôll find plenty of sites that claim to offer 50%, 60%, 70% off.  

In reality most of these links take you straight to EverWebinar‚Äôs annual or biennial plans which are already discounted. The truth is **EverWebinar doesn‚Äôt publish public coupon codes**.  

**How the offers really work:**  
- **Annual Plan Offer ‚Äì Save 50-58%:** $499/year, down from $1,188. Automatic discount.  
- **First-time user discount ‚Äì Save 30%:** Occasionally promoted at $699/year, not widely available.  
- **Biennial Plan ‚Äì Save up to 66%:** $874/2 years, effectively $37/month. Sometimes includes 3 extra months.  
- **Special promotions:** Certain deals bundle EverWebinar with extras like training or WebinarJam access.  

üëâ **Advice:** Don‚Äôt waste your time looking for a secret coupon code. Instead decide if you want monthly flexibility or the bigger savings of the annual/biennial plans. Use the official pricing page and take advantage of the 30-day guarantee.

## Final Thoughts: Is EverWebinar Worth It?

After testing EverWebinar for a month, I can say it‚Äôs a good investment if you want to automate webinars and scale funnels.  

The just-in-time scheduling, live chat simulation and marketing tools help you deliver professional presentations without being on camera. The annual and bi-annual plans save up to 66% compared to monthly.  

There‚Äôs no secret coupon beyond these, but the **30-day money-back guarantee makes trying EverWebinar risk free**.  

üëâ If you‚Äôre hesitant, start with monthly. If you use it a lot, upgrade to annual/bi-annual. And if you‚Äôre a student, educator or nonprofit, contact support for possible special pricing.  

EverWebinar won‚Äôt do the selling for you. But with good content, it gives you an automated stage.  

For me, the combination of evergreen automation, marketing tools and refund safety made it worth it.
